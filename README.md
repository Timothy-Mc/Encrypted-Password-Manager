#Password Manager
A basic password manager that securely stores passwords using AES-256-GCM encryption. The passwords are stored in SQLite data, and encryption keys are derived using PBKDF2 with SHA-256 hashtag.

## Personal Note
This is one of my first projects introducing me to encryption, and all the libraries I used were new to me.
This is just the beginning of my journey to becoming a **Security Engineer**. There will be many more projects to come as I gain more experience and confidence in my coding skills.

## Features
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: Uses industry-standard encryption for secure password storage.
- **SQLite Database Storage**: Stores encrypted credentials in a local SQLite database.
- **Key Derivation**: Generates a secure encryption key using PBKDF2 and SHA-256.
- **Interactive CLI**: Allows users to store and retrieve passwords via a command-line interface.
